# Audio-Steganography

It is an application to hide text data in audio files by using the least significant bit method (LSB). Our project implementation uses the java programming language for development of the user interfaces, embedding and extraction modules.

Steganography is the technique of hiding information in some media for the safe communication.

The Least Significant Bit Coding (LSB) :Â is one of the earliest techniques in the information hiding of digital audio, as well as other media types. In this technique LSB of binary sequences of each sample of digitized audio file is replaced with the binary equivalent of secret message. For example if we want to hide the letter A, ( binary equivalent 1000001) into a digitized audio file where each sample is represented with 16 bits, then LSB of 7 consecutive samples (each of 16 bit size) is replaced with each bit of the binary equivalent of the letter, A.
